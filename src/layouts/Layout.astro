						"@type": "Answer",
						"text": "Standard Independent Engineer reports validate compliance with provided documents but fail to question what is missing. They confirm that submitted data meets regulatory standards, but they don't interrogate strategic omissions. BiP Omega identifies Critical Silences - strategic data omissions that destroy deal economics or trigger insurance exclusions."

						"@type": "Answer",
						"text": "A Critical Silence is strategic data that should exist in public regulatory filings but is conspicuously absent. Examples include missing BMS thermal derating curves that prevent validation of summer revenue projections, absent UL9540A fire propagation data that triggers insurance exclusions, or undisclosed bridge load limits that cause MPT transport failures and 6-12 month construction delays."
